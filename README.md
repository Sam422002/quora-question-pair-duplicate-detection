# Quora Duplicate Question Detection 🔍

This project solves the **Quora Question Pairs** challenge — to identify whether two questions are duplicates using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and classical machine learning.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Given pairs of questions from Quora, predict whether they are semantically equivalent. This is a binary classification problem that has real-world use cases in search engines, forums, and Q&A platforms.

## ⚙️ What’s Inside
- ✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- ✅ Text Preprocessing (cleaning, stopwords, etc.)
- ✅ Bag-of-Words vectorization
- ✅ Handcrafted features (word overlap, fuzzy match scores, etc.)
- ✅ Classification using:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
- ✅ Model evaluation using Accuracy & F1-score

## 📦 Tech Stack
- Python, NumPy, Pandas
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- NLTK, FuzzyWuzzy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📝 Future Improvements
- Add Word2Vec or GloVe embeddings
- Try Siamese networks or BERT-based models
- Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset is from the [Quora Question Pairs Kaggle challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-question-pairs).
